# Recruit Rocket

**A full-service AI recruiting team that works for the job seeker.** It's a set of Claude skills that runs your whole search like a small recruiting firm with one client: you. It finds openings and grades them on real fit, spots companies about to hire before they post, builds a tailored ATS-ready resume, a cover letter, and a one-page stat sheet (a "baseball card") that puts your best numbers up front, writes the email and LinkedIn connect note to the right person, preps you for interviews, and tracks every follow-up.

**Nothing goes out without your yes.** The kit drafts. You approve, and you send.

Built to take the busywork out of a job search, so you spend your time on conversations, not formatting. Works at any career level.

  FOUNDATION: Intake builds your facts file. Everyone reads from it.
```

| Role | Skill | What it does | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Intake | `intake` | Reads your resume and work samples, asks about 5 easy questions, and builds your **facts file**, the single source of truth | Once, then when things change |
| Head Headhunter | `headhunter-chief-of-staff` | Daily briefing, tracker, follow-up schedule, prevents contacting anyone twice | Every morning |
| Talent Scout | `talent-scout` | Scans job boards and grades postings A/B/C against what you can prove, not job titles | Weekdays 7am, 1pm, 5pm |
| Market Intel Analyst | `signal-search` | Finds companies likely to hire before they post (new CEO, funding, acquisitions) and lists the hidden-market channels for your field | On call |
| Research Analyst | `company-research` | One-page company deep dive in their own words, and confirms who to contact with a dated source | On call |
| Brand Builder | `resume-builder`, `baseball-card`, `cover-letter`, `linkedin-review` | ATS-safe resume, one-page baseball card, short cover letter, LinkedIn headline and About rewrite | On call |
| Outreach Writer | `outreach-package` | "Receipts" email and LinkedIn note in your voice | On call |
| Fact Checker | `fact-check` | Checks every number against your facts file, catches typos and filler, flags guessed emails | **Always on** |
| Interview Coach | `interview-prep` | The 15 questions you're most likely to get, answers built from your real results, and scored mock interviews with suggestions to improve | On call |
| Offer Negotiator | `offer-negotiation` | A calm script and email that ask for one specific thing | On call |

## The rules every skill follows

1. **Your facts file is the source of truth.** No invented or rounded-up numbers, titles, or dates. If it's not in the file, Claude asks you.
2. **Numbers are said the way you approved them.** "Resolution time" and "wait time" are not the same claim.
3. **People are confirmed with a dated source** from the last 6 to 12 months.
4. **No guessed email presented as real.** Guesses are labeled, and you get a reminder to check for a bounce.
5. **You send everything.** The kit never sends email, posts, or applies.
6. **Human voice.** No em dashes, no "leverage," "unlock," "seamless," or "I'm excited to." Short, plain sentences.
7. **Research first, then write.** Every message starts from the company's own words.
8. **Check the tracker first.** No accidental double contact. Your exclusion list (non-competes, former employers) is respected.
9. **Quality check before you see it.** Proofread, fact-checked, page count verified.

## Setup (about 15 minutes, including a 10-minute intake)

### What you need
- A Claude account with skills enabled (the Claude app, Cowork, or Claude Code).
- Optional but helpful connectors: **Gmail** (so Claude can save drafts for you to send), **Google Drive** (to keep your job search folder), a browser connection for **LinkedIn**, and any **job board** connectors available to you.

### Option A: Let Claude set it up (easiest, no file handling)
1. Open the Claude desktop app and switch to **Cowork**. Choose your **Documents** folder.
2. Copy this whole message, paste it in, and press Enter:

> Please set up Recruit Rocket for me. Install these 13 skills from these links:
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/intake.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/headhunter-chief-of-staff.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/fact-check.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/talent-scout.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/signal-search.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/company-research.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/resume-builder.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/baseball-card.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/cover-letter.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/linkedin-review.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/outreach-package.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/interview-prep.zip
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/skills/offer-negotiation.zip
>
> Then create a folder called "My Job Search" in this folder, and unzip this into it (it holds a "templates" folder):
> https://github.com/brentblackmon/recruit-rocket/raw/main/dist/recruit-rocket-templates.zip
> Tell me when you're done.

3. Click **approve** when Claude asks for permission.
4. Start a new task, choose the **My Job Search** folder, attach your resume, and say: **"Set me up with Recruit Rocket."** The `intake` skill reads what you share and asks about 5 easy questions, one at a time, like a first call with a recruiter.

**If Claude says it can't install skills,** do it by hand: in Claude go to **Settings, Skills, Upload skill** and drag in the 13 `.zip` files from the kit's `dist/skills` folder (GitHub page, **Code**, **Download ZIP**, then unzip). You can drop them all in at once.

### Option B: Claude Code
```
/plugin marketplace add brentblackmon/recruit-rocket
/plugin install recruit-rocket@recruit-rocket
```
Then clone the repo (or copy `templates/`) into your working folder and say "Set me up with Recruit Rocket."

To build resumes and baseball cards as PDFs on your own computer, see [generators/README.md](generators/README.md). In Cowork and Claude Code, Claude can run these for you.

## Your first week

| Day | Do this | Say to Claude |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A 10-minute interview, then the kit scans jobs and builds resumes, cards, cover letters, and emails for your top 3 matches on its own | "Set me up with Recruit Rocket. My resume is attached." |
| 2 | Master resume and baseball card | "Build my master resume and baseball card." |
| 2 | LinkedIn headline and About | "Review my LinkedIn." |
| 3 | First job scan, then schedule it | "Run my first job scan." then "Set up my scheduled scan." |
| 3 | Signal search and hidden channels | "Find companies likely to hire someone like me." |
| 4 | First tailored package for your best A | "Research Harborline and build my outreach package." |
| 5 on | Daily routine | "What should I do today?" |

## Your daily routine (15 to 30 minutes)
1. **Morning:** "What should I do today?" The Head Headhunter lists follow-ups due, drafts waiting for you, and new A-grade jobs.
2. **Approve and send** the drafts you like. Edit anything that doesn't sound like you.
3. **Log it:** "I sent the Harborline email." Paste what you sent. The tracker sets the next follow-up.
4. **Before any interview:** "Prep me for my interview with Priya at Harborline on Thursday."

## Testing Recruit Rocket
Testers: start with [TESTING.md](TESTING.md). It has the one-message setup, what to try, and the feedback questions.

## Try it first with a test folder
Download [dist/Headhunter-Test.zip](dist/Headhunter-Test.zip), unzip it, and open `START HERE.txt`. It has a ready-made job search folder for the fictional Jordan Rivera and four tests to run in Cowork.

## See a full example
[examples/jordan-rivera/](examples/jordan-rivera/) is a complete sample run for a **fictional** job seeker: facts file, graded scan, signal search, tailored resume and baseball card PDFs, cover letter, outreach, the Fact Checker's catches, interview prep, follow-ups, a negotiation, and the tracker.
