description: Brand Builder, resume. Builds the user's master ATS-safe resume from facts.md and tailors it to one posting or company, then renders .docx and PDF with the kit's generator and runs page-count and layout QA. Use for "build my resume," "tailor my resume to this job," "update my resume," or when an A-grade posting needs materials.

# Brand Builder: Resume

One clean, ATS-safe format. Tailoring is surgical: by default only the headline and first summary paragraph change. That keeps every version true and easy to fact-check.

## Standing rules (short form)
Facts file is the source of truth; **never invent or round**. **Use approved phrasing word for word.** Dated sources for people. No guessed emails as real. The user sends everything; you never submit applications. Human voice: no em dashes, no filler, no stacked adjectives. Research first. Check the tracker. **QA before delivery.** **Offer choices to click, never blank questions.** Full text: `STANDING_RULES.md` in this skill's folder.

## The format (fixed)
Built by `generator/build-resume.js` in this skill's folder. Do not hand-format in Word.
- Single column. No tables, text boxes, columns, images, or header or footer content (ATS parsers skip or scramble them).
- Arial. Navy `1A2B4A` for the name, section heads, role titles and competencies; near-black body text; gray dates and company descriptions.
- Order: name (capitals), headline (target title in capitals, then themes), contact line with live email and LinkedIn links, navy rule, shaded stat line with a navy bar and 4 numbers, SUMMARY (2 paragraphs), KEY ACHIEVEMENTS (bold lead-in on each bullet), CORE COMPETENCIES (one bold navy line of terms), PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION AND CERTIFICATIONS.
- Each role: title in navy with dates at the right, then "Company, City, ST" in bold, then an optional italic one-line company description and an optional "Mandate:" line, then bullets.
- Length: 2 pages for experienced users (8+ years), 1 page for early career.

## Build the master resume
1. Read `facts.md`. Every line of the resume must trace to a facts line marked `CONFIRMED` or `FROM RESUME`. Before delivery, `fact-check` asks the user to confirm any `FROM RESUME` numbers in one quick batch.
2. Write `My Job Search/resume.json` in the same shape as `generator/sample-data/resume.json` in this skill's folder (a fictional example; a tailoring example is `generator/sample-data/tailor.json`):
   - `headline`: "Target Title | theme, theme and theme". The title before the bar prints in capitals.
   - `stats`: 4 numbers that best prove the target role, in approved phrasing, shortened to a value (about 12 characters) and a 1 to 3 word label. The whole stat line must fit on one line; the QA check fails if it wraps.
   - `summary`: paragraph 1 is who they are for the target role (2 sentences). Paragraph 2 is how they work and what they are known for (2 sentences).
   - `achievements`: 4 to 6 bullets, strongest numbers, each as `{"lead": "Short claim.", "text": "What you did and the result."}`. The lead prints in bold.
   - `competencies`: 6 to 9 short terms that match how recruiters search.
   - `experience`: most recent first; 3 to 6 bullets for recent roles, 1 to 2 for older ones. Each bullet: action, scope, result with number. Per company: `company`, `location`, optional `blurb` (what the company does, size) and optional `mandate` (why the user was hired), then `roles`.
   - Promotions inside one company: list each title in `roles` and put that title's bullets in `roles[].bullets`, so a reader can tell which results came from which job. Use job-level `bullets` only when the company has one role. See the first job in the sample.
3. Run the generator (see below) and QA.

## Tailor to a posting
1. Read the posting and `companies/<company-slug>/research.md` (run `company-research` first if it is missing).
2. Write `companies/<company-slug>/tailor.json` with only:
   - `headline`: mirrors the posting's title and top 2 themes, still true to the facts.
   - `summary1`: first paragraph rewritten around the company's top 2 priorities, using the posting's own terms where the facts support them.
3. Change anything else (bullet order, competencies) only if the user asks, and list what changed.
4. Never add a keyword the facts do not support. Keyword stuffing is a false claim.

## Generate
The locked layout lives in this skill's `generator/` folder (in a full kit checkout it is also at `generators/resume/`). Always try it first, so every resume matches the same format:
```
cd <this skill's folder>/generator
npm install            # first time only; installs the docx package
node build-resume.js --data <path>/resume.json [--tailor <path>/tailor.json] --out <dir>/<First_Last>_Resume_<Company> --pages 2
```
This writes the .docx and the PDF, then runs QA. The PDF step needs LibreOffice (`soffice`); the QA step needs poppler (`pdfinfo`, `pdftotext`, `pdftoppm`).

If Node is not available, or the PDF or QA tools are missing: still use the generator for the .docx if you can, then make the PDF with whatever tools you have. If you cannot run the generator at all, build the .docx yourself and copy the layout in `generator/build-resume.js` exactly (fonts, sizes, colors, order of sections, single column, shaded stat line). Then do the QA checks by looking at the result. Never stop to ask the user to install anything.

## QA before delivery (the generator runs 1 to 3; you do 4 to 6)
1. Page count equals `--pages`.
2. Each page rendered to PNG. Look at them. No orphan lines (a heading or 1 to 2 lines alone at the top or bottom of a page).
3. `pdftotext` output reads in the right order: name, headline, contact, stats, summary, and so on.
4. Run `fact-check` on the tailored text.
5. File name: `First_Last_Resume_Company.pdf` for a tailored resume, `First_Last_Resume.pdf` for the master. No "final," "v3," or dates.
6. If QA fails, fix and rerun. Common fixes: trim an older role's bullets, shorten the summary, drop one achievement.

## Output
Tell the user: file paths, page count, what was tailored (old vs. new headline and summary paragraph), and QA results. Remind them the resume PDF is for ATS uploads; the baseball card is for direct email.
