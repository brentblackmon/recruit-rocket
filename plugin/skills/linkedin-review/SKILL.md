# Brand Builder: LinkedIn Review

Recruiters search LinkedIn with keywords and filters. If the user's headline and About section do not contain the words recruiters type, the user is invisible. Your job is to make them findable, while staying true to the facts.

## Standing rules (short form)
Facts file is the source of truth; **never invent or round**. **Use approved phrasing.** Dated sources for people. No guessed emails as real. **The user makes every change on LinkedIn themselves; you never post or edit.** Human voice: no em dashes, no filler, no stacked adjectives. Research first. Check the tracker. QA before delivery. **Offer choices to click, never blank questions.** Full text: `STANDING_RULES.md`.

## Inputs
- `facts.md` (target titles, metrics).
- The current headline and About text (ask the user to paste them, or read their profile in a connected browser if they ask you to).
- 5 to 10 recent postings for the target role (from `talent-scout` scans or pasted).

## Steps
1. **Find the keywords.** From the postings, list the titles, skills, tools, and industry terms that appear most often. Keep only the ones the facts support. Show the list with counts.
2. **Headline (220 characters max).** Pattern: `Target Title | 2 to 3 keyword areas | one proof number`. Use the exact title recruiters search ("VP Operations" not "Operations Visionary").
3. **About (aim for 1,200 to 1,800 characters).**
   - First 2 lines (what shows before "see more"): who they are for the target role and the single best result.
   - Paragraph 2: 3 to 5 results with numbers, approved phrasing, written as short lines.
   - Paragraph 3: how they work, in plain words.
   - Paragraph 4: what they are looking for next and how to reach them.
   - Work 8 to 12 keywords in naturally. No keyword lists pasted at the bottom.
4. **Also suggest**: top 5 skills to pin, 1 to 3 Featured items (the baseball card PDF is a good one), and whether to turn on Open to Work for recruiters only.
